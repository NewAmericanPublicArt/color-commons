# Improvements, Suggestions, Loose Ends
####### Sydney Strzempko, New American Public Art

### Vault
* More secure acceptance (ie, not from just any source - manually add our server IP)

### Fiend
* REMOVE DEPENDENCY on 'current.csv'; remove from current filesystem and hard-delete from github history
* Ensure hardwired UTC time across all conversions

### Data Viz
* Proper CSS styling/sizing on the SVG
* Want to be able to view more than 2 tiers at a time; for some reason, "obscured nesting" pattern displayed on this v older iter
* Colorize/fill suite for nonterminal nodes; at the moment essentially randomly interpolated from the parent's name on a built-in Colorbrewer palette
* Check across all LOADS (ie, perform more thorough testing of errors)
* More MOBILE SUPPORT; check this out on a bunch of phones too
* Verify updating JSON given new request in Fiend call
